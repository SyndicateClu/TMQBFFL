## **Section I - League Officers**

### Contacting League Officers

The league officers consist of the commissioner and co-commissioner(s). Your league officers are available if you have any questions or are in need of assistance.

If your question pertains to a feature provided by our [fantasy football hosting provider](https://sleeper.app/), please utilize their [support resources](https://support.sleeper.app/en/) before contacting a league officer.

For league-specific issues, please contact the league commissioner first. If the league commissioner is unavailable, contact the co-commissioner(s).

If your issue is time-sensitive please email or text both the commissioner and co-commissioner(s) so that that a timestamp of the request will be recorded. This way we can verify the time of your request and make your roster change retroactively if necessary. The league message board is not sufficiint for time-sensitive requests at this time as the timestamp is not detailed enough.

### Commissioner Site Powers

The commissioner has the ability to (in appropriate situations) edit lineups (either current or past), add/drop players, push/undo trades, and edit game scores. Additionally the commissioner can pause/resume the draft and set/remove draft picks for teams.
<br>

### Co-Commissioner Site Powers

The Co-Commissioner(s) will have all site powers the league commissioner has so that in the event the commissioner is unavailable the co-commissioner(s) can attend to any urgent needs from league members.

### Co-Commissioner Appointment

The Commissioner can nominate up to two Co-Commissioners who will then require a majority vote by the rest of the league to be appointed.
<br>

### Dispute Arbitration

The commissioner is the final authority on all league matters, excluding disputes with a clear conflict of interest. In situations where a league vote is put forth and the outcome is a tie the commissioner will always have the tiebreaking vote. When an issue arrises where a clear conflict of interest is apparant the matter will be handled by the co-commissioner(s). If they disagree on what action should be taken the matter will be put to a league vote (the vote will exclude anyone with a conflict of interest).
<br>

### Rule Changes

In order to change an existing rule, add a new rule, or change a scoring setting, a vote must be called and receive a majority (in a tie the commissioner has the tiebreaking vote), the commissioner has the option to veto a rule change in which case it can be voted on again and receive a 2/3 majority to pass without commissioner consent.
<br>

### Collusion

Collusion will not be tolerated. A trade will be vetoed if there is evident collusion.

<br><br>
